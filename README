                      pronounced rat-mull

a simple, human-readable data storage language designed to work
seamlessly with C/C++. Unforgiving in terms of user error, with
little to no detection and prevention. use at your own risk.

                     ---changelog 1.0.1---
- add reference types, 1.1 will release when lists are
  implemented
- reference types are a new primitive allowing a composite item
  to reference a block. see the new get function.
- made numbers little-endian. and overhauled get. and maybe
  added a few other things i forgot. 
- made documentation obselete and did not update it

                     ---changelog 1.0.2---
- built list infrastructure, will add full functionality later
  - getlistlgth()
- cleaned up README(by a lot) and updated last changelog because
  it wasn't very good
- condensed the block/composite 32 bit name system into a union
  type for readability and ease of use
- added methods to assist freeing memory taken up by data bricks
  and types
- moved int representations of names of things to ratml.h and
  renamed them

                         ---TODO---
- separate reading data into different functions. will need to
  make new ones for list and real reading, probably not too bad
- new stroption of pointer to cstr
- make things look nice using https://stackoverflow.com/question
